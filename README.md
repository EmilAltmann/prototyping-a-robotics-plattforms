# prototyping a robotics plattforms
 
This project was motivated as a preparation for my diploma project. In three prototype testbeds, I tested different mechanical, electrical and programming ideas. This was done in an iterative progression. But most concepts where only done ones, because they failed or they exceeded their goals.

Many of the 3D prints were altered after creation, but I tried to keep the 3D models up to date with each alteration.
